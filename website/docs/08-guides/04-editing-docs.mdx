# Editing docs

## Prerequisites

To clone and build the website, you'll need *git* and either [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed on your system.

Start by cloning [a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the Onion repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Onion.git
```

Navigate to the `website` directory:

```sh
cd Onion/website
```

Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs groupId="pm" queryString>
<TabItem value="npm">


```sh
npm install
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">


```sh
yarn install
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Serving the website locally

To see your changes instantly as you edit, serve the website locally using this command:

<Tabs groupId="pm" queryString>
<TabItem value="npm">


```sh
npm start
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">


```sh
yarn start
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Editing content

Now you're ready to start editing the docs! Open the `website/docs` directory (or any markdown file within) in your favorite text editor, such as **Visual Studio Code**:

```sh
code docs/
```

### Notes on the file structure

Each markdown file inside the `docs` directory represents a page on the website. These are organized into categories and subcategories, with number prefixes determining their display order in the sidebar.

Some markdown files use the `.mdx` extension — these have been enhanced with support for [MDX (Markdown + React)](https://www.docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react) syntax, allowing for more interactive features.

Subcategories containing an `index.md` or `index.mdx` file use that file as the main landing page for that section.

## Propose changes via a Pull Request (PR)

When you're ready to contribute your improvements, push your changes to your fork of the Onion repository and create a Pull Request to the main repository.
