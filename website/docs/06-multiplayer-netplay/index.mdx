# Multiplayer

*![](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/assets/47260768/031e60fa-e6dd-4059-9982-3ec397a3d0cd)*

The GLO menu is your gateway to effortless multiplayer gaming! It automatically launches an optimized version of RetroArch configured specifically for Netplay — no manual setup required, just select your game and start playing with friends.

## How to use Netplay GLO menu

Select any game, then press <kbd>Y</kbd> to open the GLO menu and find the "Netplay" option in the list.
Onion intelligently selects the best core for your Netplay session, ensuring optimal compatibility and performance.

If you see "No Netplay" displayed in the GLO menu, it means there are no Netplay-compatible cores available for the selected platform (e.g., GBA doesn't support netplay).

#### Once you've selected the Netplay option, let the GLO menu guide you through the setup

- Select "**Host**" if you want to create and host a new Netplay session
- Select "**Join**" if you want to connect to an existing Netplay session
 
#### Then choose the type of Netplay session you want to start

- **[Standard Netplay](multiplayer/standardnetplay)**
 
  This mode uses your current Wi-Fi connection to create an online session accessible over the internet or your local network.

- **[Easy Netplay](multiplayer/easynetplay)**
 	
  Perfect when you have two Miyoo Mini Plus devices in the same room! "Easy Netplay" enables instant multiplayer gaming without any Wi-Fi configuration — just select and play.

- **[Easy Netplay - Pokemon Trade/Battle](multiplayer/easynetplay-pokemon)**
 	
  Available exclusively on GB/GBC systems, this mode works just like standard "Easy Netplay" but is optimized for trading and battling Pokémon with local friends — no configuration needed!



## Tips

- **Always use GLO** to launch your Netplay sessions — GLO runs RetroArch with a specially optimized configuration that prevents many crashes and freezes
- The default Netplay cores for Onion are stored in `.tmp_update/config/netplay_cores.conf`
- Since Netplay is more CPU-intensive than normal gameplay, an overclock option is available in `netplay_cores.conf` for demanding games

For example
```
Rom_Folder_Name;Core_Filename;Core_Config_Folder;CPUspeed;
GB;tgbdual_libretro.so;
SFC;snes9x2005_libretro.so;Snes9x 2005;1600;
```
